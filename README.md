About Dataset
Brain tumors are a complex and heterogeneous group of neoplasms characterized by diverse clinical behaviors and outcomes. Understanding the progression of brain tumors is crucial for devising effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. In this study, we employ a stage-based analysis and recurrence pattern investigation to gain insights into the evolution of brain tumors. By examining the temporal dynamics of tumor growth and recurrence, we aim to uncover underlying mechanisms driving disease progression and identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Our findings shed light on the intricate nature of brain tumor development and offer valuable implications for personalized treatment approaches.

Brain tumors pose significant challenges in clinical management due to their intricate biology and diverse clinical presentations. Despite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal, with high rates of recurrence and limited survival benefits for many patients. A deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular processes driving tumor progression is imperative for developing more effective therapeutic strategies. In this context, investigating the temporal dynamics of brain tumor growth and recurrence can provide valuable insights into disease evolution and guide the development of targeted interventions. In this study, we employ a stage-based analysis and recurrence pattern investigation to elucidate the complex nature of brain tumor progression.
